Digit factorial chains
Problem 74 The number 145 is well known
for the property that the sum of the
factorial of its digits is equal to 145:

    1! + 4! + 5! = 1 + 24 + 120 = 145

Perhaps less well known is 169, in that
it produces the longest chain of numbers
that link back to 169; it turns out that
there are only three such loops that exist:

    169 → 363601 → 1454 → 169
    871 → 45361 → 871
    872 → 45362 → 872

It is not difficult to prove that EVERY
starting number will eventually get stuck
in a loop. For example,

    69 → 363600 → 1454 → 169 → 363601 (→ 1454)
    78 → 45360 → 871 → 45361 (→ 871)
    540 → 145 (→ 145)

Starting with 69 produces a chain of five
non-repeating terms, but the longest
non-repeating chain with a starting number
below one million is sixty terms.

How many chains, with a starting number
below one million, contain exactly sixty
non-repeating terms?
